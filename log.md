# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# Round 1.

### Day 1: June 8, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished half the Basic JavaScript chapter from the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification (300 hours) on Free Code Camp. Then finished the Applied Visual Design chapter from the Responsive Web Design Certification (300 hours) (still on Free Code Camp). 

**Thoughts:** JavaScript is not my friend yet. I still don't really understand its use, eventhough I think today's work helped a lot. I rewarded myself by going back to HTML/CSS and learned a lot about it, and had a lot of fun. It's what I feel is missing from JavaScript right now, the fun. I hope it'll come soon. 


### Day 2: June 9, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Basic JavaScript chapter from the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on Free Code Camp. Then had a little fun with HTML and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** I guess I understand Javascript a little better. I even found some of the exercises to be fun. (Yes, I actually had fun with javascript ! unbelievable!). I still don't really grasp what it can be usefull for in web developpment.... I guess I'll get it later. 
I also got some suggestions on twitter on how to have a little bit of fun with javascript and better grasp its usefullness so I'm really happy about that.


### Day 3: June 10, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying javascript on Free Code Camp. Then went on and finished the challenges from the Responsive Web Design Certification. I also had fun with my cv, that I did in HTML & CSS as a way to practice what I had learned. I actually made a repository of it.

**Thoughts:** I did not have so much fun with javascript today, but I'm still learning the basics so I guess it's normal... I had a lot of fun with HTML and CSS though and can't wait to begin the projects of the certification. I already have a ton of ideas. 

**Link to work:** I guess the repository (https://github.com/TheDaisyMoon/mycv). (I'm not even really sure I'm using github right tbh)


### Day 4: June 11, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Only JavaScript for me today. Finished the second chapter of the JavaScript certification on free code camp. 

**Thoughts:** I did have more "oh my god that makes sense actually" moments today than ever. yay. 

**Link to work:** Twitted a little (@MagaliMilbergue)


### Day 5: June 12, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the RegEx chapter of the the Javascript certification on free code camp. Also finished the bootstrap chapter of the Front End Librairies certification. 

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of fun with bootstrap, which was not a surprise... But the fun I had with RegEx was. And it was a good confidence boost which was needed after a week struggling to understand what is supposed to be the basics. I kinda want to find a little project in javascript to have more fun.

### Day 6: June 13, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Continued my learning journey with Javascript and began the first project for free code camp. 

**Thoughts:** Javascript was okay, I think I'm getting it a little better now, still a lot of work to do. The project is fun, it's a tribute page, doing it about Roxane Gay. 

**Link to work:** Twitted a little (@MagaliMilbergue)


### Day 7: June 14, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Worked a lot on javascript and began to learn about jQuery. 

**Thoughts:** A very full day but did not feel very productive for some reason.

**Link to work:** Twitted a little (@MagaliMilbergue)


### Day 8: June 15, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Took my first break. 

**Thoughts:** I only read some articles but mostly stayed away from coding. It was my first no-code day since the 6th of May and I think I need it. I need to be more careful to not overdo it, burning out would be bad.


### Day 9: June 16, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished my first project for Free Code Camp (the Roxane Gay tribute page), or at least did most of the work, I'll probably go back to change some of the design that I mostly left untouched. Also read a lot and began the Javascript30 course. 

**Thoughts:** It was nice to go back to what I mostly understand (the tribute page) and I am very grateful to the people that suggested that I did the Javascript30 course because I think it will help a lot.

**Link to work:** Twitted a little (@MagaliMilbergue) and the project is here [https://codepen.io/thedaisymoon/pen/rEOaeR#0]



### Day 10: June 17, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Mostly worked on my portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** Changed close to everything in the CSS, still not happy about it but it's better. 



### Day 11: June 18, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Passed my javascript exam at my bootcamp.

**Thoughts:** Really struggled but finally got it right. It was very frustrating though, kinda wanted to give up after two hours with not one of my attempt at a code working. 



### Day 12: June 19, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Began learning about Reactjs and validated my first project fot the Responsive Web Design Certification on Free Code Camp. 

**Thoughts:** The project was pretty fun to do, eventhough I kept it very simple. React is another mountain to climb. 

**Link to work:** The finished project is here : [https://codepen.io/thedaisymoon/pen/rEOaeR]



### Day 13: June 20, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on learning Reactjs. 

**Thoughts:** Had some fun with it and it kinda help me understand some javascript stuff. 



### Day 14: June 21, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Still learning Reactjs and worked a little bit on my portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** I was sick so it was not a very productive day, but I still did some code so I'm okay with myself. 



### Day 15: June 22, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Mostly worked on my projects for my Free Code Camp certification. 

**Thoughts:** Was still sick so getting my brains to work was still a struggle tbh. 



### Day 16: June 23, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Reactjs then went back to javascript. 

**Thoughts:** I still feel kinda scared of javascript. I need to finally connect to that language.  



### Day 17: June 24, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Reactjs and Redux. 

**Thoughts:** Got my ass kicked and still don't really get why.  



### Day 18: June 25, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Continued my learning of Reactjs. 

**Thoughts:** The heatwave is here and my brains melted. Concentrating is close to impossible, even for the teacher. 



### Day 19: June 26, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Tried to begin learning Angular. 

**Thoughts:** The heatwave makes it impossible for me to really feel like my brain is working. 



### Day 20: June 27, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Still worked on Angular and discovered the app SoloLearn.  

**Thoughts:** Well the heat wave forced me to stay home and I tried to make the most of it but it was just impossible to do anything, and my computer did not like the heat either, so probably not the best conditions to learn yet another framework. 



### Day 21: June 28, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the second project for the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Certification. Also worked on algorithmy with javascript. 

**Thoughts:**  I was pretty happy with my project and okay with my work on javascript. Still the heat wave made it so hard to work that I had to call it a day pretty early. Can't wait for a more normal weather. 

**Link to work:** The project is here : [https://codepen.io/thedaisymoon/pen/ydpOrZ]



### Day 22: June 29, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Mostly read articles and tried some codes I found in javascript.   

**Thoughts:** Worst day of the heat wave so I kept it light.




### Day 23: June 30, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Went back to javascript to try to find a way to get it. 

**Thoughts:** Found nice ressources and tried to code but still feel a little lost. 





### Day 24: July 1st, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Began a course on Ionic. 

**Thoughts:** Not sold on Ionic, probably because I did not understand Angular well enough. 




### Day 25: July 2nd, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on javascript.  

**Thoughts:** I'm already at a quarter of my first round and it's unbelievable ! But also, javascript is hard. But also, I think I understood things I did not before, yay ! 



### Day 26: July 3rd, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Javascript, javascript javascript.... 

**Thoughts:** I really think I'm gettin it but very slowly, step by step by step by step... Kinda worried about the pace...

**Today's Progress**: Learned some of the basics of SQL.

**Thoughts:** Had a lot of fun.

**Thoughts:** SQL is still pretty fun and my projects are okay eventhough I'm not always happy with what I am doing. 





### Day 32: July  9, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Began to learn PHP. 

**Thoughts:** So excited !! 




### Day 33: July  10, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Impromptu group project at bootcamp. Was in the PHP team (eventhough we only had done half a day of it). 

**Thoughts:** Very fun and exciting. I really like our project and hope we'll get to finish it. Also, I learned so much about PHP by having to research stuff and learn by myself. 



### Day 34: July  11, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about PHP.

**Thoughts:** It actually helped me understand some javascript stuff so yay for that I guess. Also, I really like PHP at the moment.

**Thoughts:** This week was very intense and I really liked it. So interesting !




### Day 36: July  13, 2019.

### Day 36: July  14, 2019.

**Today's Progress**: Decided to restart my portfolio from scratch again, for the third time. 

**Thoughts:** I'm a little bit more okay with my choices this time and probably will end up liking it a little bit more. I hope this third time is the last, because I need to move on from it.

**Today's Progress**: Still worked on the portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** Yes, I think this will be the one.
